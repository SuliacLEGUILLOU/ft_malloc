# ft_malloc

This project is a student project realised in my last year. I contain some idea of implementation but do not use it in production.

According to documentation, it should work on any Unix system, but I only have tested it on OSX at the moment.

compile with make and CMake
`make test` run my malloc on your ls.
use `./run.sh <command>` to run any command with my malloc

The main in the test directory test some functionnality and make a huge random fizz to make sure I do not lost memory after a long time.
Other test file just prove the basic functionnality of the main function
